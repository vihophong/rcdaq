# data_acquisition
This is the DAQ repository for the time being. It will host rcdaq and the plugins.

I will try to import the existing git repository where rcdaq and the plugins have been maintained for a long time.
Let's see if that works. I don't want to loose several years worth of history.

It didn't come out the way I wanted... I wanted data_acqusition/rcdaq etc. Next try.
